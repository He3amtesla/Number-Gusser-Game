# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game where you need to guess a number that the computer has randomly selected between 0 and 100. With each guess, the computer will tell you whether your guess is higher or lower than the randomly selected number. You start with 10 points, and with each incorrect guess, you lose 1 point.

## Prerequisites:
All you need is to install Python on your system

## How to Play:
1. Enter a number between 0 and 100.
2. If your guess is higher or lower than the randomly selected number, a message will be displayed, and you will need to guess again.
3. If you guess the correct number, the game will congratulate you, and your final score will be displayed.
4. After each game, you will be asked if you want to play again or not.

## Rules:
- You start with 10 points.
- Each time you make an incorrect guess, 1 point is deducted from your score.
- When you guess the correct number, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.
- If at any time you wish to quit the game, you can type `q` to exit.
